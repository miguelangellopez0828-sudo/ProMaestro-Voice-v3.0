# ProMaestro Voice v3.0 — Cognitive-Auditory Investment Framework  
*An experimental case of real-time voice-driven financial reasoning with ChatGPT.*

---

## 1. Overview  
`ProMaestro Voice v3.0` demonstrates how a single user can transform ChatGPT into a **cognitive-auditory copilot** for equity research and portfolio analysis.  
The framework merges spoken interaction, quantitative modeling (JSON schemas), and decision logic into one continuous reasoning loop:

> **Thought → Voice → AI Processing → Voice Feedback → Human Analysis → Voice Response**

This loop removes friction between thinking and execution, enabling high-speed analysis without keyboards or screens.

## 2. Core Concept  
Each company under coverage lives in its own conversational thread that stores financial reports, 10-Q/10-K filings, and presentation data.  
The AI extracts metrics, populates a standardized JSON structure, and delivers an auditory verdict under **two possible scenarios**:

| Scenario | Criteria | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Compounder** | ≥ 5× expected multiplier, sustained growth, controlled risk | Maintain / moderate increase |
| **TenBagger** | ≥ 10× potential, accelerated growth, high asymmetry | Strategic increase |

If neither condition is met → *No Go.*

## 3. Technical Architecture  

**Modules**  
1. **Data Ingestion** — Financial documents parsed directly inside ChatGPT.  
2. **ProMaestro JSON Schema** — Defines metrics, scenarios, risk flags, and 5-year projections.  
3. **Analytical Engine** — Calculates *expected multiplier*, *prob ≥ 10×*, *Rule of 40*, dilution, etc.  
4. **Voice Output v2.0** — Condenses the result into a 20-second spoken summary (dual-scenario).  
5. **Flag System** — Green / Red signals with Kill-Switch triggers.  
6. **Quarterly Loop** — Each thread updates every fiscal quarter; outputs feed an annual consolidated table.
